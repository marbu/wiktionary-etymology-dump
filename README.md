# wiktionary etymology dump

The goal of these scripts is to to extract etymology data from wiktionary
mediawiki xml dump. The resulting code is not a reusable tool, it's rather
a demonstration of different approaches with a simple hacked together script.

Different approaches are used:

 * shell scripts using xslt + awk, or stx + awk
 * python
