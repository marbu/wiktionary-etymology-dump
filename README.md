# Wiktionary Etymology Dump

The goal of these scripts is to to extract etymology data from wiktionary
mediawiki xml dump. The resulting code is not a reusable tool, it's rather
a demonstration of different approaches with a simple hacked together script.

Different approaches tried here:

 * `stx-xsl-awk`: stx (or xslt for comparison) template with awk script
 * `python`: simple python script using `xml.etree.ElementTree.iterparse()`

Warning: no approach is fully working yet :)

## Requirements

The input file is a mediawiki xml dump of english wiktionary which is quite
large (it takes 400 MB as compressed bzip file). So it makes sense to use
streaming processing - otherwise we would have to load the whole parse xml tree
into memory which is insane :)

### Input XML file

You can get the wiktionary xml dump here:
[enwiktionary-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2](http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/latest/enwiktionary-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2)

Then for each `/mediawiki/page` in the file, we are interested in:

 * `/mediawiki/page/title/text()`, eg `woordenboek`
 * `/mediawiki/page/revision/text/text()`, but only the etymology section, eg:

```
===Etymology===
{{compound|woord|boek|t1=word|t2=book|lang=nl}}. Akin to German {{term|WÃ¶rterbuch|lang=de}} and West Frisian {{term|wurdboek|lang=fy}}.
```

The problem here is that a single word may contain multiple etymology entries
(even zero), so we need to check for additional etymology headings in the text.
Fortunately mediawiki syntax is quite simple, so no need to use special parse
for this task.

### Output

Simple text output (for check and debugging), with a possibility to change it
to sql input statements.

## Concusion

For this particular task, python script seems to be a better choice. The main
reason is that we need to do several transformations besides simple xml
processing (mediawiki parsing and sql output). Moreover python xml api is both
simple to use and powerful.
